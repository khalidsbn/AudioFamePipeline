# Project Overview

This repository contains an end-to-end machine learning pipeline designed to predict track popularity on Spotify. The project aims to analyze the relationship between various audio features and a track's popularity, with a focus on answering the following research question:

**“Which audio features most significantly influence a track’s popularity on Spotify?”**

The pipeline automates the data extraction, cleaning, and feature engineering process using Spotify's audio features, followed by the development of a regression model to predict track popularity. The project also includes an analysis of feature importance to identify the key attributes that drive track success.

## Key Features:

- **Data Collection and Preprocessing**: Collects Spotify track data through the Spotify API, followed by preprocessing and cleaning to prepare the data for analysis.
- **Feature Engineering**: Identifies relevant audio features such as danceability, energy, tempo, and others that influence track popularity.
- **Model Development**: Trains a regression model to predict track popularity based on these features.
- **Feature Importance Analysis**: Implements techniques to assess which audio features have the most significant impact on a track’s popularity.
- **Evaluation and Insights**: Assesses model performance and provides insights into the factors influencing track popularity.

## Expected Outcomes:

- **Track Popularity Prediction**: The model predicts the popularity of tracks based on audio features.
- **Feature Importance**: Identifies and ranks the audio features that most significantly influence a track’s success on Spotify.
- **Research Paper**: The findings will be documented in a research paper to contribute insights into the factors that drive track popularity in the music industry.
